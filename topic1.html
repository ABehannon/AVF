	    <ul>
	      <li>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</li>
	      <br>
	      <li>For the particular app I am looking to go with, most of the things I am looking to go with should work with html, css, or js. I am particular looking for geolocation, the accelerometer, notifications, camera use, and use of the contacts.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <br><br><br>
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?</li>
	      <br>
	      <li>I think this really just depends on what you are trying to do. For example, I think geolocation and the camera go pretty well together. There are already other apps out there that show as such, giving you the ability to take a picture and mark where you took it.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <br><br><br>
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</li>
	      <br>
	      <li>I would like to be able to use the map, geolocation to maybe mark areas of note down within the app for the user to keep information/tabs on. Working more into that, if possible what I'd really like to do is tie pictures to that, as well. Being able to use the camera, mark where it was taken or maybe being able to go to the picture, then use that picture as a store for GPS markers. We'll see what we can do, though.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <br><br><br>
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</li>
	      <br>
	      <li>Honestly, the worst thing for me has been trying to manage my time and work effort, and that is one hard thing to get down. It really doesnt ever hit you until you end up turning in something late and seeing how much of a hit it takes on grades, ugh. While its a bit hard, I've been attempting to manage my work/development a bit better rather than waiting until the last minute.</li>
