						<li>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</li>
						<br>
						<li>For the particular app I am looking to go with, most of the things I am looking to go with should work with html, css, or js. I am particular looking for geolocation, the accelerometer, notifications, camera use, and use of the contacts.</li>
					</ul>
				    
					<br><br>
					
					<ul>
						<li>What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?</li>
						<br>
						<li>I think this really just depends on what you are trying to do. For example, I think geolocation and the camera go pretty well together. There are already other apps out there that show as such, giving you the ability to take a picture and mark where you took it.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</li>
						<br>
						<li>I would like to be able to use the map, geolocation to maybe mark areas of note down within the app for the user to keep information/tabs on. Working more into that, if possible what I'd really like to do is tie pictures to that, as well. Being able to use the camera, mark where it was taken or maybe being able to go to the picture, then use that picture as a store for GPS markers. We'll see what we can do, though.</li>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?</li>
						<br>
						<li>As I started writing this, I briefly looked over my app, and realized the answer to this question was pretty much blatant: just about everything. I immediately noted that I really didnt properly section off parts of my main page. While I used header tags to separate things, I could actually section off the header tags and their following items. I originally had javascript hidden/click to show menus, but now I am a bit glad I worked around that instead.</li>
					</ul>
				    
					<br><br>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</li>
						<br>
						<li>The most common issues I am seeing amongst videos talking about these screen readers is misused tags, linked words in the middle of paragraphs, really long link URIs, and javascript causing issues with web accessibility. URIs are something that should at least be pretty simple to do. 
						<br>
						Shorting a URI will make surfing easier and quicker for accessibilty users, and is something I usually do whenever I can on my own pages anyways. 
						<br>
						Navigation bars are a big thing, too. While javascript and fancy navbars look nice, a clearly visible and simple navbar does the trick just as well. A small, simple navbar at the top of a page would allow for most readers to pick up on the links immediately. These links can be used at the top to simply get to places where needed, and if you want a large scripted CTI in the center for your visually-based users, well there ya go.</li>
					
					</ul>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</li>
						<br>
						<li>iPhone/iPad/iOS devices - This should be a given, but I'll go with it anyways since the average person who never has need for these features may or may not notice they are available! I assist users with accibility issues all the time at my office, and one of the things we do for those users is enable it if they want to use it, as well as giving them a walkthrough of the features available. Major things of note is that you can actually change the devices' touch and tracking speeds/sensitivty and even create custom gestures for those that have issues with difficulty using/touching the screen. For visual impaired you can use larger texts, pretty decent voice overs and auto-text/auto-correct via voice.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Kindle - This is another nice example. The Amazon Kindle actually has visually impaired accessibility functions. You can have the device display larger fonts so that it makes reading easier, or even have the device read out text to speech.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Color ID - This is an app that uses a device's camera to tell what the color of something is. To more advanced users, it can also give out hex color tags, or even goes "simple" mode to find the basic colors.</li>
						<br>
						<li>SayText - This app is used to read the text of whatever the device's camera sees. The user holds the camera to the image, and presses the screen, and the device will focus and read off whatever text it sees.</li>
